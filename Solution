**HUE Connection Error Resolution**
**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Check Initial Error:**
   ```
   Could not connect to hive-server:10000 (code THRIFTTRANSPORT): TTransportException(u'Could not connect to hive-server:10000',)
   ```

2. **Verify HDFS Permissions:**
   - Start by running:
     ```
     docker-compose up
     ```
   - Access the namenode container:
     ```
     docker exec -it ds-m4-hue_hive-namenode-1 bash
     ```
   - Verify and correct HDFS permissions:
     - Verification:
       ```
       hdfs dfs -stat "%u %g" /
       ```
     - If owner and group are not hdfs:hdfs, proceed with correction.
     - Correction:
       ```
       hdfs dfs -chown hdfs:hdfs /
       ```
     - Verify again:
       ```
       hdfs dfs -stat "%u %g" /
       exit
       ```

3. **Repeat for Datanodes and Other HDFS-Related Services:**
   - Repeat the above steps for datanode containers and other services related to HDFS, such as datanode, resourcemanager, hive-server, hive-metastore, etc.

4. **Skip Verification on Non-HDFS Related Containers:**
   - Avoid running HDFS commands on containers not related to HDFS, such as huedb, hive-metastore-postgresql, hue.

5. **Stop and Restart Services:**
   - Stop the services:
     ```
     docker-compose down
     ```
   - Start the services:
     ```
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

6. **Check Service Status:**
   - Use `docker ps` to ensure containers are in the "Up" state.

By following these steps, you should have addressed the permission issues related to Hadoop services and should have your environment functioning properly.
